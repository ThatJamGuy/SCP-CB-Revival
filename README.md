# THE SCP:CB Revival Project
Welcome 05, to The Revival Project.
SCP:CB Revival will eventually form to be a complete High Defenition Open-Source remake of the original SCP: Containment Breach, all built on the Unity HDRP Engine.

> [!NOTE]
> GitHub thinks this project is in the ShaderLab language and not C# for some ungodly reason. I'll fix it as soon as I figure out how.

# Contributing
I'm not a master of game development and I'm a generally lazy person, so if you think you can help out somehow I've supplied a thing below this.

### Pull Requests
You are more than welcome to fork this repo and make pull requests. I personally support this method the most, as I'm a very anti-social person. This does come with some rules though. You must:
- Ensure that the content of your pull request is meaningful to the project.
- Ensure that any code written is in a clean optimized fashion to ensure a smooth developer and player experience.
- Ensure that any code written does not contain harmful messages or slurs.
- Ensure that any assets imported by you is not copyrighted material that could get the project into trouble.

### Direct Communication
Although the less preferrable way for myself, I do have a discord server any members hoping to volunteer in the development of this game can join to inquire about helping out. In complete honesty I will be super nervous the whole time, at least until I get to know you better. [Join With dis link](https://discord.gg/rarnCP68Dk)

### Crediting
If you contribute to SCP:CBR in a meaningful manner, you will be given a spot on the credits list below, the one in the game and recieve a special role on the Discord server if you so choose to join it.
