# SCP-CB-Revival
After a rough start on the main SCP Repo (And hardly any gameplay by 120 commits ðŸ’€), I've decided it's time for a fresh start. So I present to you,
The SCP: Containment Breach Revival project (WIP name)

This one I hope to land more towards the original game while still keeping all the cool stuff I had from the original project, such as the HD graphics.
Speaking of the original REPO, you can find it here: https://github.com/ThatJamGuy/scp-project-unity

// TODO: Finish this README
