# THE SCP:CB Revival Project
Welcome 05, to The Revival Project.

SCP:CB Revival will eventually form to be a complete High Defenition remake of the original SCP: Containment Breach, all built on the Unity HDRP Engine.

# Planned Features
SCP:CB Revival has multiple planned features or changes, some that slightly deviate from the original to give a more modernized experience. Some features are:
- Fixes to bugs present in the original
- A complete graphics overhaul, with modern lighting and volumetrics
- More advanced NPC AI
- Modding support
- Multiplayer
- And more!

# Contributing
As a solo dev, progress will be slow and many issues may occur. If you feel that you can contribute to the project, I'd recommend using pull requests.
