# THE SCP:CB REVIVAL PROJECT
SCP: Containment Breach Revival is a remake of SCP:CB with a few creative liberties taken in the new Unity 6 Engine utilizing HDRP technology for HD lighting. The game is based on the works of the [SCP Foundation community](http://www.scp-wiki.net/)

>[!WARNING]
>Beware - the source code is perhaps more horrifying than the game itself!
