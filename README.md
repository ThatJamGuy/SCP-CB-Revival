- Fixes to bugs present in the original
- A complete graphics overhaul, with modern lighting and volumetrics
- More advanced NPC AI
- Modding support
- Multiplayer
- And more!

# Contributing
As a solo dev, progress will be slow and my code will not be completelly fool-proof. If you feel that you can contribute to the project, feel free to use GitHub pull requests or join the [SCP:CB Revival Discord](https://discord.gg/rarnCP68Dk) to inquire on contributing to the project! Any meaningful contributions will give you a spot in the credits menu in game, and a spot in the credits list on this page here. If you are in the Discord server, you will also recieve a special role.
