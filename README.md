## Contributing
For a basic form of contributing, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/ThatJamGuy/SCP-CB-Revival/issues).
If you'd like to more directly contribute, feel free to fork the repository and make your changes there. Once finished you can open a pull request and if approved it will be merged.
For any further questions or details you wish to provide (Or if you just want to hang out), you can find me on my Discord server which is linked above.

**What to Contribute**
- Code / system refactors
- Additional content from the base game not already present
- Additional content not from the base game that would improve the game
- Changes to existing content / systems that would improve developer or player experience
- Anything I haven't already mentioned that would speed up development and help make a better game

For code refactors/additions it's preferable that you can write code better than I can (Which probably isn't very hard), but anything helps as long as it won't be a headache to debug it later.
